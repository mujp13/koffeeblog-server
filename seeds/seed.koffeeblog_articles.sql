Fans love the fact that you get to control the strength of the coffee, plus the pots are super easy to clean. You do need a special kind of filter, though, which is pricier than the typical drip coffee filter.

('Moka',4,'Moka pots share a lot of similarities with the percolator and there’s often confusion between the two. Both need a heated surface, like a stovetop or even a campfire. However, the Moka pot produces an espresso-like drink and its brewing process is a bit different than the percolator. You need to keep more of an eye on it because when the Moka pot’s water is spent, you should remove the pot from the heat surface to avoid burnt-tasting coffee. Whereas with the percolator’s simple brewing process, the longer you leave it running, the stronger the coffee will be.','https://p1.pxfuel.com/preview/84/813/114/mocha-coffee-mocha-coffee-pot-black-breakfast-taste.jpg');
